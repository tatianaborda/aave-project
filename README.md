Aave Project
This is a project that explores the use of the Aave Protocol. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to interact with the Aave smart contracts using Solidity and web3.js. It is made in React, Express, Node and MongoDb database. I used Hardhat as development envirioment and Infura as node host.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, you can run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
You will also need to have an Ethereum wallet that supports the Aave Protocol. I recommend using Metamask for this purpose.

Usage
To use this project, you can run the following command to compile the Solidity contracts:

bash
Copy code
npm run compile
You can then deploy the contracts to a local blockchain using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run deploy
Once the contracts are deployed, you can interact with them using the functions defined in the index.js file.
